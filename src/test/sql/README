Here is a list symlinks we need to add to run the test

Run from src/test/sql directory

mkdir loader
ln -s /usr/local/bin/shp2pgsql loader
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pgsql2shp loader

Then you can run a simple test in the regress directory:

./run_test.pl --extension --verbose --topology resolve_overlap_and_gap
